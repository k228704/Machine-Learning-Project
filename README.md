# Machine-Learning-Project
Analyzed and preprocessed structured tabular data using pandas and NumPy. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib. Built regression models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost) to predict a target variable. Tuned models and evaluated performance using RÂ² and RMSE.
